# Task Manager Server
This project is a Task Manager application built using Spring Boot. It allows users to create, manage, update, and delete tasks, organize them by assigning tags, and associate tasks with different boards. The application supports features like task status tracking (e.g., "To-Do", "In Progress", "Completed") and provides a REST API for easy integration with frontend applications or other services.
